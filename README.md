# Important commands

This section contains a quick reference to commands that might get used frequently when making changes on the server.
They are also contained in the documentation, but sometimes it is easier to have a quick reference for very specific things, espescially when you do them irregularly.

## Configuration change
On changes to `configuration.py` you need to restart the services:
```
sudo systemctl restart netbox netbox-rq
```

## Plugin add

## Plugin remove

# Notes

Netbox has good documentation and there's a button inside the webpage to access a local copy of said documentation.
However, there might be some things that are worth mentioning, which will be written in this section.

## Example

This is an example note.
